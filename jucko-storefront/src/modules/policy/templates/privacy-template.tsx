    </div>
      <div>
      <h5>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
    <p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.
    If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
    Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
    Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
    Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
   <ol>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services
    <li>Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising content for our users</li>

    <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong>

    Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
    </p>
      </div>
          
    <div>  
   <span> If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</span>
    
    <p>
    We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can 
    be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your 
    information without your consent, including, for example:
    If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
    For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
    
    
    For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
    
    If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
    For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
    If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
    If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
    If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
    If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
    If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
    If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h5> 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h5>
        <p>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
          We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
          Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
          </p>   
    
     </div>


    <div>
        <h5>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h5> 
    
        <p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. 
        Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: <Link href='jucko.com/cookiepolicy'>jucko.com/cookiepolicy</Link>.

    </div>


    <div>
        <h5> 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
        <p> In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). 
        No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p> 
    </div>
  
   <div> 
    <h5>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h5>
    
    
    <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.
    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. 
    However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 
    so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. 
    Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. 
    You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right 
    (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, 
    (ii) to request rectification or erasure; 
    (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; 
    (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and

     You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 
    'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.
    We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

    Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. 
    You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 
    'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' 
    below or updating your preferences.

    
    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section 
    
   
   'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'

    If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

  <div>  
    <h5>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES.</h5>
    
    <p> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal 
      your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. 
      At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. 
      As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. 
      If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
